Maximum-likelihood estimation is the most common approach to solve the problem in the presence of long observation sequences. However, when only short sequences are available, the lack of data amplifies the risk of overfitting and regularization becomes critical. Due to the challenges of hyper-parameter tuning, state-of-the-art methods only parameterize regularizers by a single shared hyper-parameter, hence limiting the power of representation of the model. To solve both issues, we develop in this work an efficient algorithm based on variational expectation-maximization. Our approach is able to optimize over an extended set of hyper-parameters. It is also able to take into account the uncertainty in the model parameters by learning a posterior distribution over them. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods under short observation sequences.","tags":[],"title":"Learning Hawkes Processes from a Handful of Events","type":"publication"},{"authors":["\u003cem\u003eWilliam Trouleau\u003c/em\u003e","Jalal Etesami","Matthias Grossglauser","Negar Kiyavash","Patrick Thiran"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1555884000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555884000,"objectID":"56120709c6b190a7e15dcde5ba55ce01","permalink":"https://trouleau.github.io/publication/noiys-hawkes-icml2019/","publishdate":"2019-04-22T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/noiys-hawkes-icml2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Multivariate Hawkes processes (MHP) are widely used in a variety of fields to model the occurrence of discrete events. Prior work on learning MHPs has only focused on inference in the presence of perfect traces without noise. We addressthe problem of learning the causal structure of MHPs when observations are subject to an unknown delay. In particular, we introduce the so-called synchronization noise, where the stream of events generated by each dimension is subject to a random and unknown time shift. We characterize the robustness of the classic maximum likelihood estimator to synchronization noise, and we introduce a new approach for learning the causal structure in the presence of noise. Our experimental results show that our approach accurately recovers the causal structure of MHPs for a wide range of noise levels, and significantly outperforms classic estimation methods.","tags":[],"title":"Learning Hawkes Processes Under Synchronization Noise","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L Lorch","A De","S Bhatt","\u003cem\u003eW Trouleau\u003c/em\u003e","U Upadhyay","M Gomez-Rodriguez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1543359600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543359600,"objectID":"8be905bfc124ea2a9b06f34416a06358","permalink":"https://trouleau.github.io/publication/disease-control-ml4h-neurips2018/","publishdate":"2018-11-28T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/disease-control-ml4h-neurips2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Most of the early work on epidemic processes focused primarily on developing models for general population dynamics rather than the state of any given individual in the population. More recently, there has been research on modeling individual dynamics of epidemics in networks, which has been fueled by the success of network science in explaining other real world processes. However, most of these models ultimately resort to mean-field theory, which precludes them from characterizing the exact state of each individual. As a consequence, they are unable to benefit from the increasing availability of fine-grained data about disease outbreaks.\n\nIn this context, an orthogonal line of research aims to design control strategies to mitigate the spread of epidemics in networks using various optimization techniques. However, these approaches share one or more of the following shortcomings, which reduce its applicability in practice: (i) they leverage simple deterministic models of population dynamics and are thus unable to accurately assess the effect of individual treatments; (ii) they propose off-line strategies, often based on graph theoretic quantities, which do not account for the infection and recovery events of a specific epidemic over time, and as a consequence, achieve suboptimal performance; and (iii) they assume that individuals can go on and off of treatment multiple times instantaneously or vary recovery rates arbitrarily, which is not realistic in a real-world setting.\n\nIn this work, we approach the development of models and control strategies of epidemic processes from the perspective of marked temporal point processes (MTPPs) and stochastic optimal control of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with jumps. In contrast to previous work, this novel perspective is particularly well-suited to make use of fine-grained data on disease outbreaks and lets us overcome the shortcomings of current control strategies. More specifically, we focus on susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic processes and represent the times when each individual becomes infected, recovered, or treated using MTPPs. We then exploit an alternative representation using SDEs with jumps, which have recently been introduced in the machine learning literature, to cast the design of control strategies of epidemic processes as a stochastic optimal control problem. The solution to this problem provides us with treatment intensities to determine who to treat and when to do so to minimize the amount of infected individuals over time. Preliminary experiments with synthetic data show that our control strategy consistently outperforms several alternatives. Looking into the future, we believe our methodology provides a promising step towards the development of practical data-driven control strategies of epidemic processes.","tags":["Epidemic modeling","Disease modeling","SIS","Optimal Control"],"title":"Stochastic Optimal Control of Epidemic Processes in Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A Montresor","\u003cem\u003eW Trouleau\u003c/em\u003e","D Mupfasoni","M Bangert","S A Joseph","A Mikhailov","C Fitzpatrick"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1516057200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1516057200,"objectID":"de0b3209adfd783428aa6271b5b29c1b","permalink":"https://trouleau.github.io/publication/who-helminth/","publishdate":"2018-01-16T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/who-helminth/","section":"publication","summary":"Background:\nPreventive chemotherapy (PC), the large-scale administration of anthelminthics, is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the control of soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH). Since 2010, donated anthelminthics for STH have boosted the implementation of PC programmes in children, achieving global coverage of more than 60% in 2015. The WHO Global Health Estimates attribute an annual loss of over 3.3 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) to STH. The aim of this study is to estimate the impact of PC programmes on child morbidity. \nMethod:\nWe used data from the WHO Global Health Estimates, national coverage data on PC and the results of an evaluation of the impact of PC in 17 countries on morbidity previously conducted by our group. \nResults:\nWe estimated that the implementation of PC averted in 2015 over 44% of the DALYs that would have been caused in children by STH without: he control intervention. A reduction in morbidity of over 75% is expected, if the global target is reached in 2020. If the programme is subsequently maintained, morbidity from STH will be almost totally removed by 2025. \nConclusions:\nIn endemic areas, preventive chemotherapy provides a significant health benefit. We consider this estimation potentially useful to evaluate the cost utility of the investment made by several endemic countries on PC to control STH.\n","tags":[],"title":"Preventive chemotherapy to control soil-transmitted helminthiasis averted more than 500 000 DALYs in 2015","type":"publication"},{"authors":["\u003cem\u003eW Trouleau\u003c/em\u003e","A Ashkan","W Ding","B Eriksson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1471039200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1471039200,"objectID":"df8aa0e1519d2e825e0f4c5eeaea1c46","permalink":"https://trouleau.github.io/publication/kdd-binge-watching/","publishdate":"2016-08-13T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/kdd-binge-watching/","section":"publication","summary":"Easy accessibility can often lead to over-consumption, as seen in food and alcohol habits. On video on-demand (VOD) services, this has recently been referred to as binge watching, where potentially entire seasons of TV shows are consumed in a single viewing session. While a user viewership model may reveal this binging behavior, creating an accurate model has several challenges, including censored data, deviations in the population, and the need to consider external influences on consumption habits. In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical mixture model that incorporates these factors and presents a first of its kind characterization of viewer consumption behavior using a real-world dataset that includes playback data from a VOD service. From our modeling, we tackle various predictive tasks to infer the consumption decisions of a user in a viewing session, including estimating the number of episodes they watch and classifying if they continue watching another episode. Using these insights, we then identify binge watching sessions based on deviation from normal viewing behavior. We observe different types of binging behavior, that binge watchers often view certain content out-of-order, and that binge watching is not a consistent behavior among our users. These insights and our findings have application in VOD revenue generation, consumer health applications, and customer retention analysis.","tags":[],"title":"Just one more: Modeling binge watching behavior","type":"publication"}]
