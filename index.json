However, most of the existing epidemiological models either assume or result in a Poisson distribution of the number of infections caused by a single infectious individual, often called secondary infections. As a result, these models overlook the observed overdispersion in the number of secondary infections and are unable to accurately characterize infection hotspots. In this work, we aim to fill this gap by introducing a temporal point process framework that explicitly represents sites where infection hotspots may occur. Under our model, overdispersion on the number of secondary infections emerges naturally. Moreover, using an efficient sampling algorithm, we demonstrate how to apply Bayesian optimization with longitudinal case data to estimate the transmission rate of infectious individuals at sites they visit and in their households, as well as the mobility reduction due to social distancing. Simulations using fine-grained demographic data and site locations from several cities and regions demonstrate that our framework faithfully characterizes the observed longitudinal trend of COVID-19 cases. In addition, the simulations show that our model can be used to estimate the effect of testing, contact tracing, and containment at an unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution, and reveal that these measures do not decrease overdispersion in the number of secondary infections.","tags":null,"title":"Quantifying the Effects of Contact Tracing, Testing, and Containment Measures in the Presence of Infection Hotspots","type":"publication"},{"authors":["William Trouleau"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1622764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622764800,"objectID":"1f7e6a29e559ea793fb7dde981ae8a5e","permalink":"/publication/07-thesis2021/","publishdate":"2021-06-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/07-thesis2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Understanding the diffusion patterns of sequences of interdependent events is a central question for a variety of disciplines. Temporal point processes are a class of elegant and powerful models of such sequences; these processes have become popular across multiple fields of research due to the increasing availability of data that captures the occurrence of events over time. A notable example is the Hawkes process. It was originally introduced by Alan Hawkes in 1971 to model the diffusion of earthquakes and was subsequently applied across fields such as epidemiology, neuroscience, criminology, finance, genomic, and social-network analysis. A central question in these fields is the inverse problem of uncovering the diffusion patterns of the events from the observed data. The methods for solving this inverse problem assume that, in general, the data is noiseless. However, real-world observations are frequently tainted by noise in a number of ways. Most existing methods are not robust against noise and, in the presence of even a small amount of noise in the data, they might completely fail to recover the underlying dynamics. In this thesis, we remedy this shortcoming and address this problem for several types of observational noise. First, we study the effects of small event-streams that are known to make the learning task challenging by amplifying the risk of overfitting. Using recent advances in variational inference, we introduce a new algorithm that leads to better regularization schemes and provides a measure of uncertainty on the estimated parameters. Second, we consider events corrupted by unknown synchronized time delays. We show that the so-called synchronization noise introduces a bias in the existing estimation methods, which must be handled with care. We provide an algorithm to robustly learn the diffusion dynamics of the underlying process under this class of synchronized delays. Third, we introduce a wider class of random and unknown time shifts, referred to as random translations, of which synchronization noise is a special case. We derive the statistical properties of Hawkes processes subject to random translations. In particular, we prove that the cumulants of Hawkes processes are invariant to random translations and we show that cumulant-based algorithms can be used to learn their underlying causal structure even when unknown time shifts distort the observations. Finally, we consider another class of temporal point processes, the so-called Wold process that solves a computational limitation of the Bayesian treatment of Hawkes processes while retaining similar properties. We address the problem of learning the parameters of a Wold process by relaxing some of the restrictive assumptions made in the state of the art and by introducing a Bayesian approach for inferring its parameters. In summary, the results presented in this dissertation highlight the shortcomings of standard inference methods used to fit temporal point processes. Consequently, these results deepen our ability to extract reliable insights from networks of interdependent event streams.","tags":null,"title":"Learning Self-Exciting Temporal Point Processes Under Noisy Observations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jalal Etesami","William Trouleau","Matthias Grossglauser","Negar Kiyavash","Patrick Thiran"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1610668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610668800,"objectID":"6330376dfa6ea5b3c61ba51162fe116d","permalink":"/publication/06-var-wold-aistats21/","publishdate":"2021-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/06-var-wold-aistats21/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Preventive chemotherapy (PC), the large-scale administration of anthelminthics, is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the control of soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH). Since 2010, donated anthelminthics for STH have boosted the implementation of PC programmes in children, achieving global coverage of more than 60% in 2015. The WHO Global Health Estimates attribute an annual loss of over 3.3 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) to STH. The aim of this study is to estimate the impact of PC programmes on child morbidity.  Method: We used data from the WHO Global Health Estimates, national coverage data on PC and the results of an evaluation of the impact of PC in 17 countries on morbidity previously conducted by our group.  Results: We estimated that the implementation of PC averted in 2015 over 44% of the DALYs that would have been caused in children by STH without: he control intervention. A reduction in morbidity of over 75% is expected, if the global target is reached in 2020. If the programme is subsequently maintained, morbidity from STH will be almost totally removed by 2025.  Conclusions: In endemic areas, preventive chemotherapy provides a significant health benefit. We consider this estimation potentially useful to evaluate the cost utility of the investment made by several endemic countries on PC to control STH.\n","tags":null,"title":"A Variational Inference Approach to Learning Multivariate Wold Processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Farnood Salehi","William Trouleau","Matthias Grossglauser","Patrick Thiran"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1555891200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555891200,"objectID":"e8c15e548098970f6f047ee4331e9e30","permalink":"/publication/05-var-hawkes-neurips19/","publishdate":"2019-04-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/05-var-hawkes-neurips19/","section":"publication","summary":"Learning the causal-interaction network of multivariate Hawkes processes is a useful task in many applications. Maximum-likelihood estimation is the most common approach to solve the problem in the presence of long observation sequences. However, when only short sequences are available, the lack of data amplifies the risk of overfitting and regularization becomes critical. Due to the challenges of hyper-parameter tuning, state-of-the-art methods only parameterize regularizers by a single shared hyper-parameter, hence limiting the power of representation of the model. To solve both issues, we develop in this work an efficient algorithm based on variational expectation-maximization. Our approach is able to optimize over an extended set of hyper-parameters. It is also able to take into account the uncertainty in the model parameters by learning a posterior distribution over them. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods under short observation sequences.","tags":null,"title":"Learning Hawkes Processes from a Handful of Events","type":"publication"},{"authors":["William Trouleau","Jalal Etesami","Matthias Grossglauser","Negar Kiyavash","Patrick Thiran"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1555891200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555891200,"objectID":"b10fca7dec8b471f190ef6edc33ea904","permalink":"/publication/04-noisy-hawkes-icml19/","publishdate":"2019-04-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/04-noisy-hawkes-icml19/","section":"publication","summary":"Multivariate Hawkes processes (MHP) are widely used in a variety of fields to model the occurrence of discrete events.

More recently, there has been research on modeling individual dynamics of epidemics in networks, which has been fueled by the success of network science in explaining other real world processes. However, most of these models ultimately resort to mean-field theory, which precludes them from characterizing the exact state of each individual. As a consequence, they are unable to benefit from the increasing availability of fine-grained data about disease outbreaks.\nIn this context, an orthogonal line of research aims to design control strategies to mitigate the spread of epidemics in networks using various optimization techniques. However, these approaches share one or more of the following shortcomings, which reduce its applicability in practice: (i) they leverage simple deterministic models of population dynamics and are thus unable to accurately assess the effect of individual treatments; (ii) they propose off-line strategies, often based on graph theoretic quantities, which do not account for the infection and recovery events of a specific epidemic over time, and as a consequence, achieve suboptimal performance; and (iii) they assume that individuals can go on and off of treatment multiple times instantaneously or vary recovery rates arbitrarily, which is not realistic in a real-world setting.\nIn this work, we approach the development of models and control strategies of epidemic processes from the perspective of marked temporal point processes (MTPPs) and stochastic optimal control of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with jumps. In contrast to previous work, this novel perspective is particularly well-suited to make use of fine-grained data on disease outbreaks and lets us overcome the shortcomings of current control strategies. More specifically, we focus on susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic processes and represent the times when each individual becomes infected, recovered, or treated using MTPPs. We then exploit an alternative representation using SDEs with jumps, which have recently been introduced in the machine learning literature, to cast the design of control strategies of epidemic processes as a stochastic optimal control problem. The solution to this problem provides us with treatment intensities to determine who to treat and when to do so to minimize the amount of infected individuals over time. Preliminary experiments with synthetic data show that our control strategy consistently outperforms several alternatives. Looking into the future, we believe our methodology provides a promising step towards the development of practical data-driven control strategies of epidemic processes.\n","tags":["Epidemic modeling","Disease modeling\"","SIS","Optimal Control"],"title":"Stochastic Optimal Control of Epidemic Processes in Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antonio Montresor","William Trouleau","et al"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1516060800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1516060800,"objectID":"d5479e6ac2f45ef2def433fe77aa2311","permalink":"/publication/02-who-helminth-2017/","publishdate":"2018-01-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/02-who-helminth-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Temporal point-processes are often used for mathematical modeling of sequences of discrete events with asynchronous timestamps.

On video on-demand (VOD) services, this has recently been referred to as binge watching, where potentially entire seasons of TV shows are consumed in a single viewing session. While a user viewership model may reveal this binging behavior, creating an accurate model has several challenges, including censored data, deviations in the population, and the need to consider external influences on consumption habits. In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical mixture model that incorporates these factors and presents a first of its kind characterization of viewer consumption behavior using a real-world dataset that includes playback data from a VOD service. From our modeling, we tackle various predictive tasks to infer the consumption decisions of a user in a viewing session, including estimating the number of episodes they watch and classifying if they continue watching another episode. Using these insights, we then identify binge watching sessions based on deviation from normal viewing behavior. We observe different types of binging behavior, that binge watchers often view certain content out-of-order, and that binge watching is not a consistent behavior among our users. These insights and our findings have application in VOD revenue generation, consumer health applications, and customer retention analysis.","tags":null,"title":"Just one more: Modeling binge watching behavior","type":"publication"}]
