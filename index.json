Since 2010, donated anthelminthics for STH have boosted the implementation of PC programmes in children, achieving global coverage of more than 60% in 2015. The WHO Global Health Estimates attribute an annual loss of over 3.3 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) to STH. The aim of this study is to estimate the impact of PC programmes on child morbidity. Method: We used data from the WHO Global Health Estimates, national coverage data on PC and the results of an evaluation of the impact of PC in 17 countries on morbidity previously conducted by our group. Results: We estimated that the implementation of PC averted in 2015 over 44% of the DALYs that would have been caused in children by STH without: he control intervention. A reduction in morbidity of over 75% is expected, if the global target is reached in 2020. If the programme is subsequently maintained, morbidity from STH will be almost totally removed by 2025. Conclusions: In endemic areas, preventive chemotherapy provides a significant health benefit. We consider this estimation potentially useful to evaluate the cost utility of the investment made by several endemic countries on PC to control STH.","tags":[],"title":"Preventive chemotherapy to control soil-transmitted helminthiasis averted more than 500 000 DALYs in 2015","type":"publication"},{"authors":["William Trouleau","Azin Ashkan","Weicong Ding","Brian Eriksson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1471039200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1471039200,"objectID":"df8aa0e1519d2e825e0f4c5eeaea1c46","permalink":"/publication/kdd-binge-watching/","publishdate":"2016-08-13T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/kdd-binge-watching/","section":"publication","summary":"Easy accessibility can often lead to over-consumption, as seen in food and alcohol habits. On video on-demand (VOD) services, this has recently been referred to as binge watching, where potentially entire seasons of TV shows are consumed in a single viewing session. While a user viewership model may reveal this binging behavior, creating an accurate model has several challenges, including censored data, deviations in the population, and the need to consider external influences on consumption habits. In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical mixture model that incorporates these factors and presents a first of its kind characterization of viewer consumption behavior using a real-world dataset that includes playback data from a VOD service. From our modeling, we tackle various predictive tasks to infer the consumption decisions of a user in a viewing session, including estimating the number of episodes they watch and classifying if they continue watching another episode. Using these insights, we then identify binge watching sessions based on deviation from normal viewing behavior. We observe different types of binging behavior, that binge watchers often view certain content out-of-order, and that binge watching is not a consistent behavior among our users. These insights and our findings have application in VOD revenue generation, consumer health applications, and customer retention analysis.","tags":[],"title":"Just one more: Modeling binge watching behavior","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Academic is a framework to help you create a beautiful website quickly.
